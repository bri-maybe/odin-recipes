    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A traditional Indonesian fried rice recipe which is often served with a fried egg for a protein boost to make it a meal, but I usually serve it as a side dish. The magic ingredient in this is kecap manis, a sweet soy sauce which is available in large supermarkets and of course in Asian stores. Feel free to swap out the chicken for other proteins! Shrimp/prawns, tofu, beef and pork are all great alternatives.</p>
