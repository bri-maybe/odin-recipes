    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A traditional Indonesian fried rice recipe which is often served with a fried egg for a protein boost to make it a meal, but I usually serve it as a side dish. The magic ingredient in this is kecap manis, a sweet soy sauce which is available in large supermarkets and of course in Asian stores. Feel free to swap out the chicken for other proteins! Shrimp/prawns, tofu, beef and pork are all great alternatives.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <p><b>Chicken</b></p>
      <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
      <li>5 oz/150 gram chicken breast.</li>
      <li>1 tbsp kecap manis</li>
      <p><b>Rice</b></p>
      <li>1.5 tbsp oil</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 tsp red chili</li>
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>3 cups cooked white rice</li>
      <li>2 tbsp kecap manis</li>
      <li>2 tsp shrimp paste</li>
      <p><b>Garnishes / Side Servings (Optional)</b></p>
      <li>4 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 green onion</li>
      <li>Tomatos and cucumbers</li>
      <li>Fried shallots</li>
      <li>Lime wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat</li>
      <li>Add chili and garlic, stir for 10 seconds</li>
      <li>Add onion, cook for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Add chicken, cook until it mostly turns white, then add 1 tbsp kecap manis and cook for a further 1 minute or until chicken is mostly cooked through and a bit caramelised.</li>
      <li>Add rice, 2 tbsp kecap manis and shrimp paste, if using. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes until sauce reduces down and rice grains start to caramelise (key for flavour!).</li>
      <li>Serve, garnished with garnishes of choice (green onions, red chili, fried shallots).</li>
    </ol>
